It is possible to supply both a rate and a doseQuantity to provide full details about how the medication is to be administered and supplied. If the rate is intended to change over time, depending on local rules/regulations, each change should be captured as a new version of the MedicationRequest with an updated rate, or captured with a new MedicationRequest with the new rate.\r\rIt is possible to specify a rate over time (for example, 100 ml/hour) using either the rateRatio and rateQuantity.  The rateQuantity approach requires systems to have the capability to parse UCUM grammer where ml/hour is included rather than a specific ratio where the time is specified as the denominator.  Where a rate such as 500ml over 2 hours is specified, the use of rateRatio may be more semantically correct than specifying using a rateQuantity of 250 mg/hour.","type":"display"},{"answerValueSet":"#vs9","item":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-fhirType","valueString":"Ratio"}],"item":[{"linkId":"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]._null.numerator","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"numerator:","type":"decimal"},{"linkId":"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]._null.denominator","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"denominator:","type":"decimal"},{"linkId":"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]._null.units","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"units:","type":"string"}],"linkId":"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]._null","type":"group"},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-fhirType","valueString":"Range"}],"item":[{"linkId":"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]._null.low","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"low:","type":"decimal"},{"linkId":"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]._null.high","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"high:","type":"decimal"},{"linkId":"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]._null.units","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"units:","type":"string"}],"linkId":"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]._null","type":"group"},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-fhirType","valueString":"Quantity"}],"item":[{"linkId":"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]._null.comparator","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"comp:","type":"choice"},{"linkId":"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]._null.value","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"value:","type":"decimal"},{"linkId":"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]._null.units","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"units:","type":"string"},{"linkId":"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]._null.code","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"coded units:","type":"string"},{"linkId":"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]._null.system","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"units system:","type":"string"}],"linkId":"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]._null","type":"group"}],"linkId":"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]._type","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"type","type":"choice"}],"linkId":"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]","repeats":true,"required":false,"text":"Amount of medication per unit of time","type":"group"}],"linkId":"Dosage.doseAndRate","repeats":true,"required":false,"text":"Amount of medication administered","type":"group"},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-maxOccurs","valueInteger":1},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-fhirType","valueString":"Ratio"}],"item":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl","valueCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"code":"flyover","display":"Fly-over","system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control"}]}}],"text":"Upper limit on medication per unit of time.

Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.\n\nModifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself). There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions.  The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone.","type":"display"}],"linkId":"StructureMap.group.rule.dependent.modifierExtension","repeats":true,"required":false,"text":"Extensions that cannot be ignored even if unrecognized","type":"group"},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-minOccurs","valueInteger":1},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-maxOccurs","valueInteger":1},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-fhirType","valueString":"string"}],"item":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl","valueCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"code":"flyover","display":"Fly-over","system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control"}]}}],"text":"Name of a rule or group to apply.","type":"display"},{"linkId":"StructureMap.group.rule.dependent.name.value","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"Name of a rule or group to apply","type":"string"}],"linkId":"StructureMap.group.rule.dependent.name","repeats":true,"required":true,"type":"group"},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-minOccurs","valueInteger":1},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-fhirType","valueString":"string"}],"item":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl","valueCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"code":"flyover","display":"Fly-over","system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control"}]}}],"text":"Variable to pass to the rule or group.","type":"display"},{"linkId":"StructureMap.group.rule.dependent.variable.value","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"Variable to pass to the rule or group","type":"string"}],"linkId":"StructureMap.group.rule.dependent.variable","repeats":true,"required":true,"type":"group"}],"linkId":"StructureMap.group.rule.dependent","repeats":true,"required":false,"text":"Which other rules to apply in the context of this rule","type":"group"},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-maxOccurs","valueInteger":1},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-fhirType","valueString":"string"}],"item":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl","valueCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"code":"flyover","display":"Fly-over","system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control"}]}}],"text":"Documentation for this instance of data.","type":"display"},{"linkId":"StructureMap.group.rule.documentation.value","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"Documentation for this instance of data","type":"string"}],"linkId":"StructureMap.group.rule.documentation","repeats":true,"required":false,"type":"group"}],"linkId":"StructureMap.group.rule","repeats":true,"required":true,"text":"Transform Rule from source to target","type":"group"}],"linkId":"StructureMap.group","repeats":true,"required":true,"text":"Named sections for reader convenience","type":"group"}],"linkId":"StructureMap","repeats":true,"required":false,"text":"A Map of relationships between 2 structures that can be used to transform data","type":"group"}],"publisher":"Health Level Seven International (FHIR Infrastructure)","resourceType":"Questionnaire","status":"draft","version":"4.0.1"}
