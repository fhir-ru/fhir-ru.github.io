Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.\n\nModifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself). There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions.  The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone.","type":"display"}],"linkId":"ImplementationGuide.manifest.page.modifierExtension","repeats":true,"required":false,"text":"Extensions that cannot be ignored even if unrecognized","type":"group"},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-minOccurs","valueInteger":1},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-maxOccurs","valueInteger":1},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-fhirType","valueString":"string"}],"item":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl","valueCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"code":"flyover","display":"Fly-over","system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control"}]}}],"text":"Relative path to the page.
