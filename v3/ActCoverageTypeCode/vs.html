Insurance, in law and economics, is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of potential financial loss. Insurance is defined as the equitable transfer of the risk of a potential loss, from one entity to another, in exchange for a premium and duty of care. A policy holder is an individual or an organization enters into a contract with an underwriter which stipulates that, in exchange for payment of a sum of money (a premium), one or more covered parties (insureds) is guaranteed compensation for losses resulting from certain perils under specified conditions.  The underwriter analyzes the risk of loss, makes a decision as to whether the risk is insurable, and prices the premium accordingly.  A policy provides benefits that indemnify or cover the cost of a loss incurred by a covered party, and may include coverage for services required to remediate a loss.  An insurance policy contains pertinent facts about the policy holder, the insurance coverage, the covered parties, and the insurer.  A policy may include exemptions and provisions specifying the extent to which the indemnification clause cannot be enforced for intentional tortious conduct of a covered party, e.g., whether the covered parties are jointly or severably insured.

                        
                           Discussion: In contrast to programs, an insurance policy has one or more policy holders, who own the policy.  The policy holder may be the covered party, a relative of the covered party, a partnership, or a corporation, e.g., an employer.  A subscriber of a self-insured health insurance policy is a policy holder.  A subscriber of an employer sponsored health insurance policy is holds a certificate of coverage, but is not a policy holder; the policy holder is the employer.

Health insurance is typically administered in accordance with a plan, which specifies (1) the type of health services and health conditions that will be covered under what circumstances (e.g., exclusion of a pre-existing condition, service must be deemed medically necessary; service must not be experimental; service must provided in accordance with a protocol; drug must be on a formulary; service must be prior authorized; or be a referral from a primary care provider); (2) the type and affiliation of providers (e.g., only allopathic physicians, only in network, only providers employed by an HMO); (3) financial participations required of covered parties (e.g., co-pays, coinsurance, deductibles, out-of-pocket); and (4) the manner in which services will be paid (e.g., under indemnity or fee-for-service health plans, the covered party typically pays out-of-pocket and then file a claim for reimbursement, while health plans that have contractual relationships with providers, i.e., network providers, typically do not allow the providers to bill the covered party for the cost of the service until after filing a claim with the payer and receiving reimbursement).</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---terminology.hl7.org-CodeSystem-v3-ActCode-DENTAL"> </a>3</td><td style="white-space:nowrap">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../v3/ActCode/cs.html#v3-ActCode-DENTAL">DENTAL</a></td><td>dental care policy</td><td>Definition: A health insurance policy that that covers benefits for dental services.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---terminology.hl7.org-CodeSystem-v3-ActCode-DISEASE"> </a>3</td><td style="white-space:nowrap">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../v3/ActCode/cs.html#v3-ActCode-DISEASE">DISEASE</a></td><td>disease specific policy</td><td>Definition: A health insurance policy that covers benefits for healthcare services provided for named conditions under the policy, e.g., cancer, diabetes, or HIV-AIDS.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---terminology.hl7.org-CodeSystem-v3-ActCode-DRUGPOL"> </a>3</td><td style="white-space:nowrap">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../v3/ActCode/cs.html#v3-ActCode-DRUGPOL">DRUGPOL</a></td><td>drug policy</td><td>Definition: A health insurance policy that covers benefits for prescription drugs, pharmaceuticals, and supplies.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---terminology.hl7.org-CodeSystem-v3-ActCode-HIP"> </a>3</td><td style="white-space:nowrap">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../v3/ActCode/cs.html#v3-ActCode-HIP">HIP</a></td><td>health insurance plan policy</td><td>Definition: A health insurance policy that covers healthcare benefits by protecting covered parties from medical expenses arising from health conditions, sickness, or accidental injury as well as preventive care.

Managed care uses medical protocols and procedures agreed on by the medical profession to be cost effective, also known as medical practice guidelines.

However, there is a greater cost associated with choosing these non-network providers. A covered party will usually pay deductibles and coinsurances that are substantially higher than the payments when he or she uses a plan provider.

For persons related by blood, a substantial interest established through love and affection, and for all other persons, a lawful and substantial economic interest in having the life of the insured continue. An insurable interest is required when purchasing life insurance on another person. Specific exclusions are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer; for example claims resulting from suicide or relating to war, riot and civil commotion.

                        
                           Discussion:A life insurance policy may be used by the covered party as a source of health care coverage in the case of  a viatical settlement, which is the sale of a life insurance policy by the policy owner, before the policy matures. Such a sale, at a price discounted from the face amount of the policy but usually in excess of the premiums paid or current cash surrender value, provides the seller an immediate cash settlement. Generally, viatical settlements involve insured individuals with a life expectancy of less than two years. In countries without state-subsidized healthcare and high healthcare costs (e.g. United States), this is a practical way to pay extremely high health insurance premiums that severely ill people face. Some people are also familiar with life settlements, which are similar transactions but involve insureds with longer life expectancies (two to fifteen years).</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---terminology.hl7.org-CodeSystem-v3-ActCode-ANNU"> </a>3</td><td style="white-space:nowrap">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../v3/ActCode/cs.html#v3-ActCode-ANNU">ANNU</a></td><td>annuity policy</td><td>Definition: A policy that, after an initial premium or premiums, pays out a sum at pre-determined intervals.

                           Discussion: Reinsurance is a means by which an insurance company can protect itself against the risk of losses with other insurance companies. Individuals and corporations obtain insurance policies to provide protection for various risks (hurricanes, earthquakes, lawsuits, collisions, sickness and death, etc.). Reinsurers, in turn, provide insurance to insurance companies.

                        For example, an HMO may purchase a reinsurance policy to protect itself from losing too much money from one insured's particularly expensive health care costs. An insurance company issuing an automobile liability policy, with a limit of $100,000 per accident may reinsure its liability in excess of $10,000. A fire insurance company which issues a large policy generally reinsures a portion of the risk with one or several other companies.

A program is an organized structure for administering and funding coverage of a benefit package for covered parties meeting eligibility criteria, typically related to employment, health, financial, and demographic status. Programs are typically established or permitted by legislation with provisions for ongoing government oversight.  Regulations may mandate the structure of the program, the manner in which it is funded and administered, covered benefits, provider types, eligibility criteria and financial participation. A government agency may be charged with implementing the program in accordance to the regulation.  Risk of loss under a program in most cases would not meet what an underwriter would consider an insurable risk, i.e., the risk is not random in nature, not financially measurable, and likely requires subsidization with government funds.

                        
                           Discussion: Programs do not have policy holders or subscribers.  Program eligibles are enrolled based on health status, statutory eligibility, financial status, or age.
