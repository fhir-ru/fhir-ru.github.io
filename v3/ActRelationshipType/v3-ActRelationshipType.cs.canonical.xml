                        A contraindication is just a negation of a reason, i.e. it gives a condition under which the action is not to be done. Both, source and target can be any kind of service; target service is in criterion mood. How the strength of a contraindication is expressed (e.g., relative, absolute) is left as an open issue. The priorityNumber attribute could be used.<br/>

                           Description: The reason or rationale for a service. A reason link is weaker than a trigger, it only suggests that some service may be or might have been a reason for some action, but not that this reason requires/required the action to be taken. Also, as opposed to the trigger, there is no strong timely relation between the reason and the action.  As well as providing various types of information about the rationale for a service, the RSON act relationship is routinely used between a SBADM act and an OBS act to describe the indication for use of a medication.  Child concepts may be used to describe types of indication. <br/>

                        
                           Discussion: In prior releases, the code &quot;SUGG&quot; (suggests) was expressed as &quot;an inversion of the reason link.&quot; That code has been retired in favor of the inversion indicator that is an attribute of ActRelationship.<br/>

                           Rationale: There is a need when defining a clinical trial protocol to indicate that the protocol makes use of other protocol or treatment specifications.  This is stronger than the assertion of &quot;references&quot;.  References may exist without usage, and in a clinical trial protocol is common to assert both: what other specifications does this trial use and what other specifications does it merely reference.<br/>

                        A trigger-match links an actual service (e.g., an observation or procedure that took place) with a service in criterion mood.  For example if the trigger is &quot;observation of pain&quot; and pain is actually observed, and if that pain-observation caused the trigger to fire, that pain-observation can be linked with the trigger.<br/>

                        A relationship between a source Act that provides more detailed properties to the target Act.<br/>

                        The source act thus is a specialization of the target act, but instead of mentioning all the inherited properties it only mentions new property bindings or refinements.<br/>

                        The typical use case is to specify certain alternative variants of one kind of Act. The priorityNumber attribute is used to weigh refinements as preferred over other alternative refinements.<br/>

                        Example: several routing options for a drug are specified as one SubstanceAdministration for the general treatment with attached refinements for the various routing options.<br/>

                        Constraints: the &quot;completion track&quot; mood of the target Act must be equally or more &quot;actual&quot; than the source act. I.e., when the target act is EVN the source act can be EVN, or any INT. If the target act is INT, the source act can be INT.<br/>

For example, if the start and end of an ST elevation episode is visible in an EKG, this relation would indicate the ROI bounds the  &quot;ST elevation&quot; observation -- the ROI defines the true beginning and ending of the episode.  Conversely, if a ROI simply contains ST elevation, but it does not define the bounds (start and end) of the episode, the more general &quot;has support&quot; relation is used.  Likewise, if a ROI on an image defines the true bounds of a &quot;1st degree burn&quot;, the relation &quot;has bounded support&quot; is used; but if the ROI only points to the approximate area of the burn, the general &quot;has support&quot; relation is used.<br/>

                        The ActRelationshipType &quot;has subject&quot; is similar to the ParticipationType &quot;subject&quot;, Acts that primarily operate on physical subjects use the Participation, those Acts that primarily operate on other Acts (other information) use the ActRelationship.<br/>

                           UsageNote: This relationship allows the result of an observation to be fully expressed as RIM acts as opposed to being embedded in the value attribute.  For example, sending a Document act as the result of an imaging observation, sending a list of Procedures and/or other acts as the result of a medical history observation.<br/>

                        The valueNegationInd attribute on the source Act has the same semantics of &quot;negated finding&quot; when it applies to the target of a VALUE ActRelationship as it does to the value attribute.  On the other hand, if the ActRelationship.negationInd is true for a VALUE ActRelationship, that means the specified observation does not have the indicated value but does not imply a negated finding.  Because the semantics are extremely close, it is recommended that Observation.valueNegationInd be used, not ActRelationship.negationInd.<br/>
