                           This code is currently the same string as the print name for this concept and is inconsistent with the conventions being used for the other codes in the coding system, as it is a full word with initial capitalization, rather than an all upper case mnemonic.  The recommendation from OO is to deprecate the code &quot;Carrier&quot; and to add &quot;CAR&quot; as the new active code representation for this concept.<br/>

                        NOTE 1: An isolate that is interpreted as non-susceptible does not necessarily mean that the isolate has a resistance mechanism.

This is predictive that this combination therapy will not be effective. <br/>

                        
                           Usage Note: Since the use of penicillin or ampicillin alone often results in treatment failure of serious enterococcal or other bacterial infections, combination therapy is usually indicated to enhance bactericidal activity. The synergy between a cell wall active agent (such as penicillin, ampicillin, or vancomycin) and an aminoglycoside (such as gentamicin, kanamycin or streptomycin) is best predicted by screening for high-level bacterial resistance to the aminoglycoside.<br/>

                        A category for isolates where the bacteria (e.g. enterococci) are susceptible in vitro to a combination therapy (e.g., high-level aminoglycoside and cell wall active agent).  This is predictive that this combination therapy will be effective. <br/>

                        
                           Usage Note: Since the use of penicillin or ampicillin alone often results in treatment failure of serious enterococcal or other bacterial infections, combination therapy is usually indicated to enhance bactericidal activity. The synergy between a cell wall active agent (such as penicillin, ampicillin, or vancomycin) and an aminoglycoside (such as gentamicin, kanamycin or streptomycin) is best predicted by screening for high-level bacterial resistance to the aminoglycoside.<br/>

                        
                           Open Issue: The print name of the code is very general and the description is very specific to a pair of classes of agents, which may lead to confusion of these concepts in the future should other synergies be found.<br/>

                           This antimicrobial susceptibility test interpretation concept is recommended by OO to be deprecated as it is no longer recommended for use in susceptibility testing by CLSI (reference CLSI document M100-S22; Vol. 32 No.3; CLSI Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing; Twenty-Second Informational Supplement. Jan 2012).  <br/>

                           Open Issue: EX, HX, LX: These three concepts do not seem to meet a clear need in the vocabulary, and their use in observation interpretation appears likely to be covered by other existing concepts (e.g., A, H, L).  The only apparent significant difference is their reference to use in protocols for exclusion of study subjects.
These concepts/codes were proposed by RCRIM for use in the CTLaboratory message.  They were submitted and approved in the November 2005 Harmonization cycle in proposal &quot;030103C_VOCAB_RCRIM_l_quade_RCRIM Obs Interp_20051028154455&quot;.  However, this proposal was not fully implemented in the vocabulary.  The proposal recommended creation of the x_ClinicalResearchExclusion domain in ObservationInterpretation with a value set including those three concepts/codes, but there is no subdomain of that name or equivalent with a binding to either of the value sets that contain these concepts/codes.
Members of the OO WG have recently attempted to contact members of RCRIM regarding these concepts, both by email and at the recent WGM in Atlanta, without response.  It is felt by OO that the best course of action to take at this time is to add this comprehensive Open Issue rather than deprecate these three concepts at this time, until further discussion is held.<br/>
