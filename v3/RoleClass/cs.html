 <tr><td>Definition:</td><td><p>Codes for the Role class hierarchy.  The values in this hierarchy, represent a Role which is an association or relationship between two entities - the entity that plays the role and the entity that scopes the role.  Roles names are derived from the name of the playing entity in that role. The role hierarchy stems from three core concepts, or abstract domains:    RoleClassOntological
is an abstract domain that collects roles in which the playing entity is defined or specified by the scoping entity.   RoleClassPartitive
collects roles in which the playing entity is in some sense a "part" of the scoping entity.   RoleClassAssociative
collects all of the remaining forms of association between the playing entity and the scoping entity. This set of roles is further partitioned between:    RoleClassPassive
which are roles in which the playing entity is used, known, treated, handled, built, or destroyed, etc. under the auspices of the scoping entity. The playing entity is passive in these roles in that the role exists without an agreement from the playing entity.   RoleClassMutualRelationship
which are relationships based on mutual behavior of the two entities. The basis of these relationship may be formal agreements or they may bede facto
behavior.  Thus, this sub-domain is further divided into:    RoleClassRelationshipFormal
in which the relationship is formally defined, frequently by a contract or agreement.   Personal relationship
which inks two people in a personal relationship. The hierarchy discussed above is represented In the current vocabulary tables as a set of abstract domains, with the exception of the  "Personal relationship" which is a leaf concept.  OpenIssue:

In Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), permissions are operations on an object that a user wishes to access. Permissions are grouped into roles.          A role characterizes the functions a user is allowed to perform. Roles are assigned to users. If the user's role has the appropriate permissions          to access an object, then that user is granted access to the object. FHIR readily enables RBAC, as FHIR Resources are object types and the CRUDE          events (the FHIR equivalent to permissions in the RBAC scheme) are operations on those objects.          In Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), a user requests to perform operations on objects. That user's access request is granted or denied          based on a set of access control policies that are specified in terms of attributes and conditions. FHIR readily enables ABAC, as instances of          a Resource in FHIR (again, Resources are object types) can have attributes associated with them. These attributes include security tags,          environment conditions, and a host of user and object characteristics, which are the same attributes as those used in ABAC. Attributes help          define the access control policies that determine the operations a user may perform on a Resource (in FHIR) or object (in ABAC). For example,          a tag (or attribute) may specify that the identified Resource (object) is not to be further disclosed without explicit consent from the patient.)</li>

                        A role class played by a person who receives benefit coverage under the terms of a particular insurance policy.  The underwriter of that policy is the scoping entity.  The covered party receives coverage because of some contractual or other relationship with the holder of that policy.<br/>

                        
                           Discussion:This reason for coverage is captured in 'Role.code' and a relationship link with type code of indirect authority should be included using the policy holder role as the source, and the covered party role as the target.<br/>

                        Note that a particular policy may cover several individuals one of whom may be, but need not be, the policy holder.  Thus the notion of covered party is a role that is distinct from that of the policy holder.<br/>

                           Description: A role played by a party making a claim for coverage under a policy or program.  A claimant must be either a person or organization, or a group of persons or organizations.  A claimant is not a named insured or a program eligible.<br/>

                        
                           Discussion: With respect to liability insurance such as property and casualty insurance, a claimant must file a claim requesting indemnification for a loss that the claimant considers covered under the policy of a named insured.  The claims adjuster for the policy underwriter will review the claim to determine whether the loss meets the benefit coverage criteria under a policy, and base any indemnification or coverage payment on that review.  If a third party is liable in whole or part for the loss, the underwriter may pursue third party liability recovery.  A claimant may be involved in civil or criminal legal proceedings involving claims against a defendant party that is indemnified by an insurance policy or to protest the finding of a claims adjustor. With respect to life insurance, a beneficiary designated by a named insured becomes a claimant of the proceeds of coverage, as in the case of a life insurance policy.  However, a claimant for coverage under life insurance is not necessarily a designated beneficiary.<br/>

                        
                           Note: A claimant is not a named insured.  However, a named insured may make a claim under a policy, e.g., an insured driver may make a claim for an injury under his or her comprehensive automobile insurance policy.  Similarly, a program eligible may make a claim under program, e.g., an unemployed worker may claim benefits under an unemployment insurance program, but parties playing these covered party role classes are not, for purposes of this vocabulary and in an effort to clearly distinguish role classes, considered claimants.<br/>

                        In the case of a named insured making a claim, a role type code INSCLM (insured claimant) subtypes the class to indicate that either a named insured or an individual insured has filed a claim for a loss.  In the case of a program eligible, a role type code INJWKR (injured worker) subtypes the class to indicate that the covered party in a workers compensation program is an injured worker, and as such, has filed a "claim" under the program for benefits.  Likewise, a covered role type code UNEMP (unemployed worker) subtypes the program eligible class to indicate that the covered party in an unemployment insurance program has filed a claim for unemployment benefits.<br/>

                        
                           Example: A claimant under automobile policy that is not the named insured.<br/>

                           Description: A role played by a party to an insurance policy to which the insurer agrees to indemnify for losses, provides benefits for, or renders services.  A named insured may be either a person, non-person living subject, or an organization, or a group of persons, non-person living subjects, or organizations.<br/>

                        
                           Discussion: The coded concept NAMED should not be used where a more specific child concept in this Specializable value set applies.  In some cases, the named insured may not be the policy holder, e.g., where a policy holder purchases life insurance policy in which another party is the named insured and the policy holder is the beneficiary of the policy.<br/>

                        
                           Note: The party playing the role of a named insured is not a claimant in the sense conveyed by the RoleClassCoveredParty CLAIM (claimant).  However, a named insured may make a claim under a policy, e.g., e.g., a party that is the named insured and policy holder under a comprehensive automobile insurance policy may become the claimant for coverage under that policy e.g., if injured in an automobile accident and there is no liable third party.  In the case of a named insured making a claim, a role type code INSCLM (insured claimant) subtypes the class to indicate that a named insured has filed a claim for a loss.<br/>

                        
                           Example: The named insured under a comprehensive automobile, disability, or property and casualty policy that is the named insured and may or may not be the policy holder.<br/>

                           Description: A role played by a person covered under a policy or program based on an association with a subscriber, which is recognized by the policy holder.<br/>

                        
                           Note:  The party playing the role of a dependent is not a claimant in the sense conveyed by the RoleClassCoveredParty CLAIM (claimant).  However, a dependent may make a claim under a policy, e.g., a dependent under a health insurance policy may become the claimant for coverage under that policy for wellness examines or if injured and there is no liable third party.  In the case of a dependent making a claim, a role type code INSCLM (insured claimant) subtypes the class to indicate that the dependent has filed a claim for services covered under the health insurance policy.<br/>

                        
                           Example: The dependent has an association with the subscriber such as a financial dependency or personal relationship such as that of a spouse, or a natural or adopted child.  The policy holder may be required by law to recognize certain associations or may have discretion about the associations.  For example, a policy holder may dictate the criteria for the dependent status of adult children who are students, such as requiring full time enrollment, or may recognize domestic partners as dependents.  Under certain circumstances, the dependent may be under the indirect authority of a responsible party acting as a surrogate for the subscriber, for example, if the subscriber is differently abled or deceased, a guardian ad Lidem or estate executor may be appointed to assume the subscriberaTMs legal standing in the relationship with the dependent.<br/>

                           Discussion: The policy holder holds the contract with the policy or program underwriter.  The subscriber holds a certificate of coverage under the contract.  In legal proceedings concerning the policy or program, the terms of the contract takes precedence over the terms of the certificate of coverage if there are any inconsistencies.<br/>

                           Description: Specifies the player Entity (the equivalent Entity) as an Entity that is considered to be equivalent to a reference Entity (scoper).  The equivalence is in principle a symmetric relationship, however, it is expected that the scoper is a reference entity which serves as reference entity for multiple different equivalent entities. <br/>

                        
                           Examples: An innovator's medicine formulation is the reference for "generics", i.e., formulations manufactured differently but having been proven to be biologically equivalent to the reference medicine. Another example is a reference ingredient that serves as basis for quantity specifications (basis of strength, e.g., metoprolol succinate specified in terms of metoprolol tartrate.)<br/>
