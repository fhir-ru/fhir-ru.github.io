The questions may be included directly or by reference to a Questionnaire resource that defines the questions as well as the constraints on the allowed answers. In some cases, both may be provided to provide both formal rules for editing the questionnaire (via link to Questionnaire) as well as sufficient local information to allow rendering of the questionnaire. \r\n\r\nQuestionnaires cover the need to communicate data originating from forms used in medical history examinations, research questionnaires and sometimes full clinical speciality records. In many systems this data is collected using user-defined screens and forms. Questionnaires record specifics about data capture - exactly what questions were asked, in what order, what choices for answers were, etc. Each of these questions are part of the Questionnaire, and as such the Questionnaire is a separately identifiable Resource, whereas the individual questions are not. \r\n\r\nExamples of Questionnaires include: \r\n\r\n* Past medical history (PMH)\r\n* Family diseases\r\n* Social history\r\n* Research questionnaires\r\n* Quality and evaluation forms\r\nQuestionnaireAnswers can be validated against their corresponding Questionnaire to verify that required groups and questions are answered and that answers fit constraints in terms of cardinality, data type, etc.",
