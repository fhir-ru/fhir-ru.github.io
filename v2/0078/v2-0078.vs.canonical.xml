Note 1: Bacterial strains are categorized as intermediate by applying the appropriate breakpoints in a defined phenotypic test system.

Note 2: This class of susceptibility implies that an infection due to the
isolate can be appropriately treated in body sites where the drugs are physiologically concentrated or when a high dosage of drug can be used.

Note 3: This class also indicates a &#x201C;buffer zone,&#x201D; to prevent small, uncontrolled, technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretations.

Note 4: These breakpoints can be altered due to changes in circumstances (e.g., changes in commonly used drug dosages, emergence of new resistance mechanisms).</td><td>from v2.1, removed after v2.8.2</td></tr><tr><td>IE<a name="IE"> </a></td><td>Insufficient evidence</td><td>There is insufficient evidence that the species in question is a good target for therapy with the drug.

Synonym: decreased susceptibility

Note 1: An isolate that is interpreted as non-susceptible does not necessarily mean that the isolate has a resistance mechanism. It is possible that isolates with MICs above the susceptible breakpoint that lack resistance mechanisms may be encountered within the wild-type distribution subsequent to the time the susceptible-only breakpoint is set.

This is predictive that this combination therapy will not be effective. 

Usage Note: Since the use of penicillin or ampicillin alone often results in treatment failure of serious enterococcal or other bacterial infections, combination therapy is usually indicated to enhance bactericidal activity. The synergy between a cell wall active agent (such as penicillin, ampicillin, or vancomycin) and an aminoglycoside (such as gentamicin, kanamycin or streptomycin) is best predicted by screening for high-level bacterial resistance to the aminoglycoside.
