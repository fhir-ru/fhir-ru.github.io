Codes P, F, and S identify sets (batteries) and should be associated with an OM5 segment that defines the list of elements.  The definitions for the contained elements would have to be sent in other independent OMx segments, one for each contained element.  In the ASTM context, most text reports &#x2013; such as discharge summaries, admission H&amp;Ps, and chest X-ray reports &#x2013; are considered as sets, in which each section of the report (e.g., description, impression, and recommendation of an X-ray report) is considered a separate observation</td><td>added v2.2</td></tr></table>
